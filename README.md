## Overview
In order to provide insights on revenue trends, sales performance by category and size, and customer behaviour based on time and order patterns, the Pizza Sales & Analysis project focusses on analysing sales data from a pizza chain. Using key performance metrics like total revenue, average order value, and total pizzas sold, the dashboard helps business stakeholders evaluate peak sales periods, best and worst-selling pizzas, and overall business health.

**2.Pizza Category and Size Breakdown**: Shows how sales are divided into categories (like Classic, Chicken, Supreme, and Veggie) and sizes (like Small, Medium, and Large).
**3.Best & Worst Sellers**: This feature helps with inventory management and marketing decisions by identifying the top 5 pizzas based on sales volume and the bottom 5 worst sellers.
**4.Daily and Hourly Trends**: Indicates when customers are most active by displaying hourly sales patterns throughout the day and order trends over the course of the week.
**5.Sales Performance Metrics**: Shows the total revenue, average order value, number of pizzas sold, and average number of pizzas per order, among other important business performance metrics.
